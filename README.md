# Line-coding-encoder-and-scrambler
With the help of "graphics.h" library,i implemented line coding encoder and scrambler in c++.
Program generates random binary stream and gives longest palindromic subsequence as input to the encoding schemes .we get output as per the encoding scheme chosen by user.
Available encoding schemes are NRZ-L,NRZ-I,MANCHESTER,DIFFERENTIAL MANCHESTER,AMI(with B8ZS AND HDB3 scrambling schemes).
